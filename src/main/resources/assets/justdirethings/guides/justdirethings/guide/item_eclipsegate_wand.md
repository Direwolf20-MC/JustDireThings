# Eclipsegate Wand

The Eclipsegate Wand represents the pinnacle of magical tool development, featuring unparalleled powers.

In addition to the [Voidshift Wand](./item_voidshift_wand.md) abilities, you can activate the Eclipse Gate ability. Simply right click on a block, and all blocks around and behind it disappear temporarily!

After a few moments the original blocks will return as they were. Block Entities like chests are not affected.

The setting screen lets you adjust the range of this ability.
