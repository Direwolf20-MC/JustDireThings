# Eclipse Alloy Paxel

The Eclipse Alloy Paxel represents the pinnacle of tool integration, combining the functionality of a pickaxe, axe, and shovel into a single formidable tool. 

Craft it either by combining an Eclipse Alloy Pickaxe, Axe, and Shovel in a smithing table, or upgrade a [Celestigem Paxel](./tool_celestigem_paxel.md) using the smithing table. Both methods preserve any installed upgrades.
