# Advanced Portal Gun

The Advanced Portal Gun enhances the functionality of the standard portal gun by adding a favorites menu. Activate the menu with the default hotkey 'v'.

In the menu, you can add locations, allowing you to save the position where your player is standing. Fire a projectile that opens a portal to the saved location from anywhere.

You can hold multiple favorites, edit their names, and remove them as needed. Additionally, you can toggle the 'Stay Open' option to control whether the menu stays open or requires you to hold the hotkey.

You must fill the gun with [Portal Fluid](./res_portal_fluid.md), by right clicking on a source block, or using a [Fluid Canister](./item_fluid_canister.md).
